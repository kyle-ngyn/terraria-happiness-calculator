# Terraria Happiness Calculator

A simple NPC happiness calculator for Terraria to be used in the terminal. You can manually add NPCs to any biome and see the happiness levels of all NPCs for your setup.

Realistically, the Goblin Tinkerer and the Nurse are the two most important NPCs to keep as happy as possible.
